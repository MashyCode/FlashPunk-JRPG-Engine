Explanation of combat stats:

- damageRating is the overall power of a weapon
- damageType is kind of damage the weapon causes (piercing, impact, slashing or magic)
- armorRating is overall strength of all armor combined
- attackType says wether the attack is melee or ranged. when a player executes a melee attack,
  a counter attack can be suffered, depending on the target enemy


Long term method of damage calcuation:

for example, a short sword with damageRating of 10, damageType of slashing.
armorRating of 11 (torso: 5, head: 2, legs: 2, hands: 0, feet: 2).
the attack is targetted on the torso, which has armorResistance vs slashing +1, meaning torso's attackRating is boosted by 1. 
torso's armorRating in that attack is now at 6. 
Now it must be seen if the attacker successfully manages to attack the torso, so we look at the agility of the attacker,
which is at 5 of 10, and the agility of the target, which is at 6 of 10. So, we have a chance to hit the target 
being the average of 50% and 60% = 55% to miss, or 45% to hit. If the strike hits, we'll have a damage of 10 - 6 = 4;


Temporary method of damage calculation:

For now, in combat, single body parts are not targettable. The armor rating of all pieces of armor just adds up to become
the overall armor rating. damage rating does not take into account the relationship between damage type and armor resistances.
Rather, damage rating and armor rating and agilities are factored into the damage calculation for now.

ABOUT
=====

This is an engine that enables game developers to create games in the style of old SNES JRPGs. It's the version I'm constantly working on, on my blog (http://thedolgion.com) there is a tutorial explaining the code. Since the code has grown too much in size for me to make individual lessons with a parallel developing code, the source here is the reference for those tutorials from now on. Once the Engine contains all the planned core features, it will be possible to create games similar to Lufia 2, Final Fantasy 6 with relative ease. Many of the elementary features (maps, movement...) will be already coded, and one can focus more on asset creation. Users are allowed to alter the code as they wish, and are not forbidden to sell software based on or using this engine.
